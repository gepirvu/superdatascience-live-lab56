# superdatascience-live-lab56
In this live lab, we’ll go from a raw customer churn dataset to a working machine learning model on Databricks step by step, together. We’ll use the free version of Databricks, explore the data, and then let Databricks ML train a first baseline model that we can inspect and improve.
